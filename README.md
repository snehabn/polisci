#POLISCI
##Description
Polisci is focusing on demystifying local political candidates to the general public. There is so much information out there, but most of the time you have to go to multiple websites to get the full picture on any given candidate. With this project we are striving to provide factual and unbiased information on your local political candidates from reliable sources.

##Technologies Used
* Back End: Sinatra, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL
* Front End: Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Materialize, Spotfire
* APIs: Vote Smart
